# Business-process-modeling
Business process modeling project for the architecture and structure of an eCinema information system.


This project was made in program ‘Open Model Sphere’ which is not in use today and licenses have expired. Instead, Visual Paradigm is a much better solution for these types of projects and has the same options for creating different kind of diagrams . This original project could not be exported in Visual Paradigm, so diagrams are presented as .png files in the main folder. 
Explanation of every single diagram and its’ proper use is intruded in the documentation of this project: MODELIRANJEPOSLOVNIHPROCESA_INFORMACIJSKISISTEM_eKINO.pdf.
